        <h2>Where did THOR© come from?</h2>
        
        <p>Thor was first made at the hands of Thomas Loki, a medicinal soldier in the Swedish Army who used the beverage as a form of painkiller. The drink allowed soldiers of the Swedish Army to forage through the hellish terrain of the battlefeild with minimal fatigue or tiredness. This led to the Allied Forces ultimate victory against the Fascist movements of Germamy and Thomas Loki ended up selling the drink the business man, Dave Dishwell who turned the medicinal stamina booster into the popular drink we all know today, THOR©.
