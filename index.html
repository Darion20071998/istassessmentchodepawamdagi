      <h2>Where did THOR© come from?</h2>

      <p>
        Thor was first made at the hands of Mikael Loki, a medicinal soldier in
        the Swedish Army who used the beverage as a form of painkiller. The
        drink, which had been dubbed "Blixt" at the time, allowed soldiers of the Swedish Army to forage through the hellish
        terrain of the battlefield with minimal fatigue or tiredness. This led
        to the Allied Forces ultimate victory against the Fascist movements of
        Germamy and Mikael Loki ended up selling the drink the business man,
        Dave Dishwell who turned the medicinal stamina booster into the popular
        drink we all know today, THOR©.
